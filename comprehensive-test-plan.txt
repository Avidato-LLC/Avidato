Comprehensive Test Plan for Avidato App (October 21, 2025)


1. Authentication & Access
	Unit Tests:
	- Test utility functions for authentication (e.g., password hashing, session creation).
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoints for email/password and Google OAuth login/signup, including database interaction.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate user signup/login via UI, verify redirect to dashboard, and session persistence.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., session expiration, login redirect) do not reappear.

	Note: Google OAuth E2E test is skipped due to cross-origin automation limitations. Manual completion is required for full flow verification. All other authentication tests are completed and passing.

2. Student Management
	Unit Tests:
	- Test validation logic for student fields.
	- Test utility functions for filtering, searching, and sorting students.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoints for adding, editing, archiving, deleting, and fetching students.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate adding, editing, archiving, deleting students via UI, including confirmation dialogs and pagination.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., deletion confirmation, archiving logic) do not reappear.

3. Learning Plan Generation
	Unit Tests:
	- Test topic generation logic and methodology selection functions.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoint for generating and regenerating learning plans.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate generating and viewing learning plans via UI, verify correct display of topics and methodology.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., incorrect topic count, methodology mismatch) do not reappear.

4. Lesson Generation & Viewing
	Unit Tests:
	- Test lesson generation logic and exercise component rendering.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoints for lesson generation, fetching, and sharing.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate generating, viewing, and sharing lessons via UI, including public access and error states.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., lesson not found, share link issues) do not reappear.

5. Lesson Data & API
	Unit Tests:
	- Test data mapping and transformation functions for lessons.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoints for lesson and student lesson data retrieval.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate fetching and displaying lesson data in the UI.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., incorrect lesson data, API errors) do not reappear.

6. Limits & Stats
	Unit Tests:
	- Test logic for calculating limits and stats.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API endpoints for stats and limit enforcement.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate reaching daily limits and viewing dashboard stats via UI.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., incorrect limit enforcement, stat display) do not reappear.

7. UI & Navigation
	Unit Tests:
	- Test individual UI components for correct rendering and props.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test component interaction and navigation logic.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate user navigation across all major app sections, test theme switching and responsiveness.
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., navigation errors, layout issues) do not reappear.

8. Error Handling
	Unit Tests:
	- Test error handling logic in utility functions and components.
	Integration Tests:
	- Test API error responses and form validation.
	End-to-End Tests:
	- Simulate error scenarios in the UI (e.g., failed API calls, invalid form submissions, not found pages).
	Regression Tests:
	- Ensure previously fixed bugs (e.g., missing error messages, unhandled errors) do not reappear.

9. Test Automation & GitHub Workflows
	- All unit, integration, E2E, and regression tests must run automatically on every pull request using CI (e.g., GitHub Actions).
	- If any test fails, the pull request is blocked from merging.
	- Workflow should include:
		- Install dependencies
		- Run linting and formatting checks
		- Run all test suites (unit, integration, E2E)
		- Report results in PR status
	- Branch protection rules must enforce passing status checks before merge to main.
